# Getting Started with Vite and React

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, but we'll be using Vite instead. Vite is a faster and more efficient build tool than Create React App.

## Usage

To start your app in development mode, run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the app at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

To build your app for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `build` folder.

For more information on using Vite with React, check out the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#react).
